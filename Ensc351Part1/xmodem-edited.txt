    At the request of Rick Mallinak on behalf of the guys at
    Standard Oil with IBM P.C.s, as well as several previous
    requests, I finally decided to put my modem protocol into
    writing. It had been previously formally published only in the
    AMRAD newsletter. [drawn from 
    http://www.totse.com/en/technology/telecommunications/xmodem.html ]

    2  Transmission Medium Level Protocol

    Asynchronous, 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit.

    The protocol imposes no restrictions on the contents of the data being
    transmitted.  No control characters are looked for in the 128-byte data
    [chunks].  Absolutely any kind of data may be sent - binary, ASCII, etc.
    The protocol has not formally been adapted to a 7-bit environment for the
    transmission of ASCII-only (or unpacked-hex) data , although it could be
    simply by having both ends agree to AND the protocol-dependent data with
    7F hex before validating it.  I specifically am referring to the checksum,
    and the block numbers and their ones-complement.

    Those wishing to maintain compatibility of the CP/M file structure, i.e.
    to allow modemming ASCII files to or from CP/M systems [Microsoft OSes 
    seem generally compatible -- wcs] should follow this data format:

       + ASCII tabs used (09H); tabs set every 8.

       + Lines terminated by CR/LF (0DH 0AH)

       + End-of-file [for an ASCII text file] indicated by ^Z (1AH).  (one or more)

	[so I guess a non CP/M system wanting to maintain compatibility 
	with CP/M could if desired perform a conversion before 
	breaking the data from a file into 128-byte chunks]

       + Data is variable length, i.e. should be considered a continuous
         stream of data bytes, broken into 128-byte chunks purely for the
         purpose of transmission.

       + A CP/M "peculiarity": If the data ends exactly on a 128-byte
         boundary, i.e. CR in 127, and LF in 128, a subsequent sector [(i.e. chunk)]
         containing the ^Z EOF character(s) is optional, but is preferred.
         Some utilities or user programs still do not handle EOF without ^Zs.
         [The receiving side, if running on CP/M or similar OS, can detect
         this condition and handle it by adding the ^Z sector if desired -- wcs]

       + The last block sent is no different from others, i.e.  there is no
         "short block" [so pad the last block (with perhaps ^Z) if necessary].


                  Figure 1.  XMODEM Message Block Level Protocol

    Each block of the transfer looks like:
          <SOH><blk #><255-blk #><--128 data bytes--><cksum>
    in which:

    <SOH>         = 01 hex
    <blk #>       = binary number, starts at 01 increments by 1, and
                    wraps 0FFH to 00H (not to 01)
    <255-blk #>   = blk # after going thru 8080 "CMA" instr, i.e.
                    each bit complemented in the 8-bit block number.
                    Formally, this is the "ones complement".

    [the above makes up the header -- wcs]

    <cksum>       = the [8-bit] sum of the data bytes only.  Toss any carry.


    3  File Level Protocol

    3.1  Common_to_Both_Sender_and_Receiver
    [... -- wcs]

    [When waiting for the beginning of a block or for an acknowledgement to
    a block that has been sent, recognize a sequence of two
    consecutive <can> (Hex 18) characters without modem errors (overrun,
    framing, etc.) as a transfer abort command.  The check for two consecutive <can> 
    characters reduces the number of transfers aborted by line hits.  Having a single 
    "abort" character
    makes the transmission susceptible to false termination due to an <ack>
    <nak> <soh> or <eot> being corrupted into a <can> and aborting transmission.  
    Send eight <can> characters when trying to abort.  The sender can send the 
    <can> characters in pairs with a gap of more than 1 second between each pair to
    avoid the possibility of some receivers purging all the characters should the first
    one be corrupted -- wcs (includes information from section 4.1 of the document 
    "ymodem.txt")]

    The protocol may be considered "receiver driven" [... (additional text removed to 
    avoid confusion) -- wcs].

    3.2  Receive_Program_Considerations
    The receiver has a 10-second timeout.  It sends a <nak> [when] it
    times out.  The receiver's first timeout, which sends a <nak>, signals the
    transmitter to start.  Optionally, the receiver could send a <nak>
    immediately, in case the sender was ready.  This would save the initial 10
    second timeout.  However, the receiver MUST continue to timeout [at] 10
    second [interval]s in case the sender wasn't ready.

    Once into [] receiving a block, the receiver goes into a one-second timeout
    for [the rest of the header,] each character and the checksum.  If the receiver 
    wishes to <nak> a block for any reason (including 
    an invalid header or a timeout waiting to receive an SOH, EOT, or CAN), it 
    must wait for the line to clear.  See "programming tips" for ideas.  [The receiver 
    should abort the transfer with <can> characters after receiving an 11th bad block 
    in a row.]

    Synchronizing:  If a valid [header] is received, [the block number] it [contains] 
    will be: 1) the
    expected one, in which case everything is fine; or 2) [the number] of the
    previously received block.  This should be considered OK, and only
    indicates that the receiver's <ack> got glitched, and the sender re-
    transmitted; 3) any other block number indicates a fatal loss of
    synchronization, such as the rare case of the sender getting a line-glitch
    that looked like an <ack> -- abort the transmission, sending [after the line 
    clears] a [sequence of eight] <can> [characters in the fashion described above].


    3.3  Sending_program_considerations
    While waiting for [an <ack>, <nak>, or initial <can> character], the sender 
    has only a single very
    long timeout, say one minute.  [... (additional text removed to avoid confusion) 
    -- wcs]  [Abort the file transfer upon the very long (1-minute) timeout.]

    [The sender should abort the transfer with <can> characters after receiving an 
    11th <nak> in a row.]

    When the sender has no more data, it sends an <eot>, and awaits an <ack>,
    resending the <eot> if it [gets a <nak> or something invalid], [...] with the sender 
    only having the high-level 1-minute timeout to abort.  [We will have the receiver
    always send a <nak> after the first <eot>, just to make sure that a <soh> hadn't
    been glitched into an <eot> -- wcs].


    Here is a sample of the data flow, sending a 3-block message.  It includes
    the two most common line hits - a garbaged block, and an <ack> reply
    getting garbaged.  [It also includes an <ack> being dropped.]  xx represents the 
    checksum byte.

    4  Programming Tips

       + The character-receive subroutine should be called with a parameter
         specifying the number of seconds to wait.  The receiver should first
         call it with a time of 10, then <nak> and try again, [up to] 10 times. 
         [Abort the transfer after 10 times.]

         After receiving the <soh>, the receiver should call the character
         receive subroutine with a 1-second timeout, for the remainder of the
         [block including] the <cksum>.  Since they are sent as a continuous stream,
         timing out of this implies a serious [] glitch that caused, say,
         [131] characters to be seen [for the block] instead of [132].

       + When the receiver wishes to <nak>, it should call a "PURGE"
         subroutine, to wait for the line to clear.  [] the sender [should toss]
         any characters in its UART buffer immediately upon completing sending
         a block, to ensure no [buffered] glitches [get] mis-interpreted [as an 
         <ack> or <nak>].

         The most common technique is for "PURGE" to call the character
         receive subroutine, specifying a 1-second timeout* and looping
         back [] until a timeout occurs.  The <nak> is then sent,
         [avoiding the situation of the sender tossing it away].

       + You may wish to add code recommended by John Mahr to your character
         receive routine - to set an error flag if the UART shows framing
         error, or overrun.  [<nak> a block if the error flag is set for any of 
         the bytes in the block.]  This will help catch a few more glitches - the
         most common of which is a hit in the high bit of the byte in two
         [] bytes.  The <cksum> comes out OK since [summing] in 1-byte
         produces the same result [when] adding 80H + 80H as [when] adding 00H +
         00H.

    5.  XMODEM/CRC Overview [information from chapter 8 of the document "ymodem.txt")]

    Original 1/13/85 by John Byrns -- CRC option. [É]

    The CRC used in the [X]Modem Protocol is an alternate form of block check
    which provides more robust error detection than the original checksum.
    Andrew S. Tanenbaum says in his book, Computer Networks, that the CRC-
    CCITT used by the Modem Protocol will detect all single and double bit
    errors, all errors with an odd number of bits, all burst errors of length
    16 or less, 99.997% of 17-bit error bursts, and 99.998% of 18-bit and
    longer bursts.[1]

    The changes to the Modem Protocol to replace the checksum with the CRC are
    straight forward. If that were all that we did we would not be able to
    communicate between a program using the old checksum protocol and one
    using the new CRC protocol. An initial handshake was added to solve this
    problem. The handshake allows a receiving program with CRC capability to
    determine whether the sending program supports the CRC option, and to
    switch it to CRC mode if it does. This handshake is designed so that it
    will work properly with programs which implement only the original
    protocol. A description of this handshake is presented in section 5.2.

                Figure 11.  Message Block Level Protocol, CRC mode

    Each block of the transfer in CRC mode looks like:
         <SOH><blk #><255-blk #><--128 data bytes--><CRC hi><CRC lo>
    in which:
    <SOH>        = 01 hex
    <blk #>      = binary number, starts at 01 increments by 1, and
                   wraps 0FFH to 00H (not to 01)
    <255-blk #>  = ones complement of blk #.
    <CRC hi>     = byte containing the 8 hi order coefficients of the CRC.
    <CRC lo>     = byte containing the 8 lo order coefficients of the CRC.

    5.1  CRC Calculation

    5.1.1  Formal_Definition
    To calculate the 16 bit CRC the message bits are considered to be the
    coefficients of a polynomial. This message polynomial is first multiplied
    by X^16 and then divided by the generator polynomial (X^16 + X^12 + X^5 +
    1) using modulo two arithmetic. The remainder left after the division is
    the desired CRC. Since a message block in the Modem Protocol is 128 bytes
    or 1024 bits, the message polynomial will be of order X^1023. The hi order
    bit of the first byte of the message block is the coefficient of X^1023 in
    the message polynomial.  The lo order bit of the last byte of the message
    block is the coefficient of X^0 in the message polynomial.

    The following XMODEM crc routine is taken from "rbsb.c".  Please refer to
    the source code for these programs (contained in RZSZ.ZOO) for usage.  A
    fast table driven version is also included in this file.

    updcrc(c, crc)
    register c;
    register unsigned crc;
    {
            register count;

            for (count=8; --count>=0;) {
                    if (crc & 0x8000) {
                            crc <<= 1;
                            crc += (((c<<=1) & 0400)  !=  0);
                            crc ^= 0x1021;
                    }
                    else {
                            crc <<= 1;
                            crc += (((c<<=1) & 0400)  !=  0);
                    }
            }
            return crc;
    }

        supervisory functions are not protected by this CRC.

    5.2  CRC File Level Protocol Changes

    5.2.1  Common_to_Both_Sender_and_Receiver
    The only change to the File Level Protocol for the CRC option is the
    initial handshake which is used to determine if both the sending and the
    receiving programs support the CRC mode. All Modem Programs should support
    the checksum mode for compatibility with older versions.  A receiving
    program that wishes to receive in CRC mode implements the mode setting
    handshake by sending a <C> in place of the initial <nak>.  If the sending
    program supports CRC mode it will recognize the <C> and will set itself
    into CRC mode, and respond by sending the first block with a CRC. 
    If the sending program does not support CRC mode it will
    not respond to the <C> at all. After the receiver has sent the <C> it will
    wait up to 3 seconds for the <soh> that starts the first block. If it
    receives a <soh> within 3 seconds it will assume the sender supports CRC
    mode and will proceed with the file exchange in CRC mode. [É] 
    If the receiver wishes to use
    checksum mode it should send an initial <nak> and the sending program
    should respond to the <nak> as defined in the original Modem Protocol.
    After the mode has been set by the initial <C> or <nak> the protocol
    [generally] follows the original Modem Protocol and is [more or less] identical 
    [except with respect to the use of checksums or CRCs].


    5.2.2  Receive_Program_Considerations
    There are at least 4 things that can go wrong with the mode setting
    handshake.

      1.  the initial <C> can be garbled or lost.

      2.  the initial <soh> can be garbled.

      3.  the initial <C> can be changed to a <nak>.

      4.  the initial <nak> from a receiver which wants to receive in checksum
          can be changed to a <C>.

    The first problem can be solved if the receiver sends additional <C>s after
    it times out[. Consider sending a total of 4 <C>'s] before sending a <nak> and
    switching to checksum mode[. Sending too many <C>'s may cause] 
    a sending program without CRC support [to]
    time out and abort. Repeating the <C> will also fix the second problem [as
    described in the next subsection].

    It is possible to fix problems 3 and 4 but probably not worth the trouble
    since they will occur very infrequently. They could be fixed by switching
    modes in either the sending or the receiving program after a large number
    of successive <nak>s. This solution would risk other problems however.


    5.2.3  Sending_Program_Considerations
    The sending program should start in the checksum mode. This will insure
    compatibility with checksum only receiving programs. Anytime a <C> is
    received before the first <nak> or <ack> the sending program should set
    itself into CRC mode and [send the first block]. The sender
    should respond to additional <C>s [by resending the first block with a CRC] until 
    the first <ack> is received. This will assist the receiving program in determining
    the correct mode when the <soh> is lost or garbled. After the first <ack>
    is received the sending program should ignore <C>s.


    5.3  Data Flow Examples with CRC Option

    Here is a data flow example for the case where the receiver requests
    transmission in the CRC mode but the sender does not support the CRC
    option.  <xx> represents the checksum byte.

                            <---                <C>
                                    times out after 3 seconds,
                            <---                <C>
                                    times out after 3 seconds,
